# Measurement-Invariance-of-Colorblind-Racial-Attitudes-Scale

Colorblind racial ideology (CBRI) is a manifestation of modern racism grounded in the belief that that race no longer influences social stratification (Neville et al., 2000). CBRI is often represented by egalitarian attitudes, such as the idea that all Americans are treated equally and have fair access to resources and opportunities (Neville et al., 2000). A central tenet of CBRI is that Americans live in a post-racial society. However, the literature on contemporary racial inequalities indicates that race remains a relevant social stratification mechanism across multiple domains, including income, housing, health, and education (Jones, 1997; Paradies et al., 2015; Priest et al., 2013). The purpose of CBRI is to maintain White supremacy by understating the continued importance of race in peoples’ experiences (Neville et al., 2000). Instead of attributing the cause of social inequalities to racism and other structures of oppression (e.g., classism, sexism), CBRI attributes to the blame to individual differences in talent, effort, and achievement. 

Despite the relevance of CBRI in understanding how racism affects individuals today, there is only one published measure designed to assess peoples’ colorblind beliefs: the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS) developed by Neville and colleagues (2000). However, the CoBRAS assumes that all racial groups interpret and internalize colorblindness in the same way. We know from racial formation theory that there are nuanced differences in how racial groups experience racism (Omi & Winant, 1993). To date, few studies have examined whether racial groups share a commensurable interpretation of the CoBRAS. This oversight is of particular concern because the original measurement development study oversampled Whites relative to racial minorities (Neville et al., 2000). In support of possible measurement non-invariance across race, Neville and colleagues (2013) found that when racial minorities completed the CoBRAS, they consistently scored lower than Whites. Moreover, Keum and colleagues (2018) determined that a bifactor, rather than oblique three-factor, model better represented the factor structure of the CoBRAS for Asian Americans.

The purpose of the present study was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the CoBRAS across race. In order to achieve this objective, I tested 
(1) the factor structure of the CoBRAS using confirmatory factor analysis in a racially heterogeneous sample; 
(2) measurement invariance of the CoBRAS between Whites and racial minorities; 
(3) measurement invariance of the CoBRAS across racial minority groups (monoracial Black, monoracial Asian, monoracial Latinx, and multiracial); and 
(4) the internal reliability estimates and evidence of validity for the CoBRAS.
